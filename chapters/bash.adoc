cmd 2> file

# Append stdout of cmd to a file.
cmd >> file

# Append stderr of cmd to a file.
cmd 2>> file

# Redirect stdout and stderr of cmd to a file.
cmd &> file

# Another way to redirect both stdout and stderr of cmd to a file. 
# This is not the same as cmd 2>&1 > file. Redirection order matters!
cmd > file 2>&1

# Discard stdout of cmd.
cmd > /dev/null

# Discard stderr of cmd.
cmd 2> /dev/null

# Discard stdout and stderr of cmd
cmd &> /dev/null

# Redirect the contents of the file to the standard input (stdin) of cmd.
